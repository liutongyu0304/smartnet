        cross entropy with soft max layer.
        for input a with shape of (m, C), where m is the number of samples, C is number of class.
        soft max operation:
            y_hat = exp(a) / sum(exp(a), axis=0)
        with shape of (m, C).

        shape of one hot encoding y_hat is (m, C), and only one entry is 1 for each row.

            loss = -sum(y * ln(y_hat))
        finally backward gradient of loss to a:
            dloss / da = y_hat - y.
